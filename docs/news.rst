Psycopg 3.2.8 (unreleased)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix `DateFromTicks` and `TimeFromTicks` return values to return date and
  time referred as UTC rather than the local timezone. Change
  `TimestampFromTicks` to return a datetime in UTC rather than in the local
  timezone (:ticket:`#1058`).


Psycopg 3.2.7

  `~Connection.notifies()` generator (:ticket:`#972`).
- Raise the correct error returned by the database (such as `!AdminShutdown`
  or `!IdleInTransactionSessionTimeout`) instead of a generic
  `OperationalError` when a server error causes a client disconnection
  (:ticket:`#988`).
- Build macOS dependencies from sources instead using the Homebrew versions
  in order to avoid problems with ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` (:ticket:`#858`).
- Bump libpq to 17.2 in Linux and macOS binary packages.

Psycopg 3.2.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Release binary packages including PostgreSQL 17 libpq (:ticket:`#852`).


Psycopg 3.2.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Drop `!TypeDef` specifications as string from public modules, as they cannot
  be composed by users as `!typing` objects previously could (:ticket:`#860`).
- Release Python 3.13 binary packages.


Psycopg 3.2.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix packaging metadata breaking ``[c]``, ``[binary]`` dependencies
  (:ticket:`#853`).


Psycopg 3.2
-----------

.. rubric:: New top-level features

- Add support for integer, floating point, boolean `NumPy scalar types`__
  (:ticket:`#332`).
- Add `!timeout` and `!stop_after` parameters to `Connection.notifies()`
  (:ticket:`340`).
- Allow dumpers to return `!None`, to be converted to NULL (:ticket:`#377`).
- Add :ref:`raw-query-cursors` to execute queries using placeholders in
  PostgreSQL format (`$1`, `$2`...) (:tickets:`#560, #839`).
- Add `capabilities` object to :ref:`inspect the libpq capabilities
  <capabilities>` (:ticket:`#772`).
- Add `~rows.scalar_row` to return scalar values from a query (:ticket:`#723`).
- Add `~Connection.cancel_safe()` for encrypted and non-blocking cancellation
  when using libpq v17. Use such method internally to implement
  `!KeyboardInterrupt` and `~cursor.copy` termination (:ticket:`#754`).
- The `!context` parameter of `sql` objects `~sql.Composable.as_string()` and
  `~sql.Composable.as_bytes()` methods is now optional (:ticket:`#716`).
- Add `~Connection.set_autocommit()` on sync connections, and similar
  transaction control methods available on the async connections.
- Add a `size` parameter to `~Cursor.stream()` to enable results retrieval in
  chunks instead of row-by-row (:ticket:`#794`).

.. rubric:: New libpq wrapper features

- Add support for libpq functions to close prepared statements and portals
  introduced in libpq v17 (:ticket:`#603`).
- Add support for libpq encrypted and non-blocking query cancellation
  functions introduced in libpq v17 (:ticket:`#754`).
- Add support for libpq function to retrieve results in chunks introduced in
  libpq v17 (:ticket:`#793`).
- Add support for libpq function to change role passwords introduced in
  libpq v17 (:ticket:`#818`).

.. rubric:: Other changes

- Drop support for Python 3.7.
- Prepared statements are now :ref:`compatible with PgBouncer <pgbouncer>`.
  (:ticket:`#589`).
- Disable receiving more than one result on the same cursor in pipeline mode,
  to iterate through `~Cursor.nextset()`. The behaviour was different than
  in non-pipeline mode and not totally reliable (:ticket:`#604`).
  The `Cursor` now only preserves the results set of the last
  `~Cursor.execute()`, consistently with non-pipeline mode.
