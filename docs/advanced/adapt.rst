Data adaptation configuration
=============================

The adaptation system is at the core of Psycopg and allows to customise the
way Python objects are converted to PostgreSQL when a query is performed and
how PostgreSQL values are converted to Python objects when query results are
returned.

.. note::
    For a high-level view of the conversion of types between Python and
    PostgreSQL please look at :ref:`query-parameters`. Using the objects
    described in this page is useful if you intend to *customise* the
    adaptation rules.

- Adaptation configuration is performed by changing the
  `~psycopg.abc.AdaptContext.adapters` object of objects implementing the
  `~psycopg.abc.AdaptContext` protocol, for instance `~psycopg.Connection`
  or `~psycopg.Cursor`.

- Every context object derived from another context inherits its adapters
  mapping: cursors created from a connection inherit the connection's
  configuration.

  By default, connections obtain an adapters map from the global map
  exposed as `psycopg.adapters`: changing the content of this object will
  affect every connection created afterwards. You may specify a different
  template adapters map using the *context* parameter on
  `~psycopg.Connection.connect()`.

- The `!adapters` attributes are `AdaptersMap` instances, and contain the
  mapping from Python types and `~psycopg.abc.Dumper` classes, and from
  PostgreSQL OIDs to `~psycopg.abc.Loader` classes. Changing this mapping
  (e.g. writing and registering your own adapters, or using a different
  configuration of builtin adapters) affects how types are converted between
  Python and PostgreSQL.

  - Dumpers (objects implementing the `~psycopg.abc.Dumper` protocol) are
    the objects used to perform the conversion from a Python object to a bytes
    sequence in a format understood by PostgreSQL. The string returned
    *shouldn't be quoted*: the value will be passed to the database using
    functions such as :pq:`PQexecParams()` so quoting and quotes escaping is
    not necessary. The dumper usually also suggests to the server what type to
    use, via its `~psycopg.abc.Dumper.oid` attribute.

  - Loaders (objects implementing the `~psycopg.abc.Loader` protocol) are
    the objects used to perform the opposite operation: reading a bytes
    sequence from PostgreSQL and creating a Python object out of it.

  - Dumpers and loaders are instantiated on demand by a `~Transformer` object
    when a query is executed.

.. note::
    Changing adapters in a context only affects that context and its children
    objects created *afterwards*; the objects already created are not
    affected. For instance, changing the global context will only change newly
    created connections, not the ones already existing.


.. _adapt-example-xml:

Writing a custom adapter: XML
-----------------------------

Psycopg doesn't provide adapters for the XML data type, because there are just
too many ways of handling XML in Python. Creating a loader to parse the
`PostgreSQL xml type`__ to `~xml.etree.ElementTree` is very simple, using the
`psycopg.adapt.Loader` base class and implementing the
`~psycopg.abc.Loader.load()` method:

.. __: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-xml.html

.. code:: python

    >>> import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
    >>> from psycopg.adapt import Loader

    >>> # Create a class implementing the `load()` method.
    >>> class XmlLoader(Loader):
    ...     def load(self, data):
    ...         return ET.fromstring(data)

    >>> # Register the loader on the adapters of a context.
    >>> conn.adapters.register_loader("xml", XmlLoader)

    >>> # Now just query the database returning XML data.
    >>> cur = conn.execute(
    ...     """select XMLPARSE (DOCUMENT '<?xml version="1.0"?>
    ...            <book><title>Manual</title><chapter>...</chapter></book>')
    ...     """)

    >>> elem = cur.fetchone()[0]
    >>> elem
    <Element 'book' at 0x7ffb55142ef0>

The opposite operation, converting Python objects to PostgreSQL, is performed
by dumpers. The `psycopg.adapt.Dumper` base class makes it easy to implement one:
you only need to implement the `~psycopg.abc.Dumper.dump()` method::

    >>> from psycopg.adapt import Dumper

    >>> class XmlDumper(Dumper):
    ...     # Setting an OID is not necessary but can be helpful
    ...     oid = psycopg.adapters.types["xml"].oid
    ...
    ...     def dump(self, elem):
    ...         return ET.tostring(elem)

    >>> # Register the dumper on the adapters of a context
    >>> conn.adapters.register_dumper(ET.Element, XmlDumper)

    >>> # Now, in that context, it is possible to use ET.Element objects as parameters
    >>> conn.execute("SELECT xpath('//title/text()', %s)", [elem]).fetchone()[0]
    ['Manual']

Note that it is possible to use a `~psycopg.types.TypesRegistry`, exposed by
any `~psycopg.abc.AdaptContext`, to obtain information on builtin types, or
extension types if they have been registered on that context using the
`~psycopg.types.TypeInfo`\.\ `~psycopg.types.TypeInfo.register()` method.


.. _adapt-example-float:

Example: PostgreSQL numeric to Python float
-------------------------------------------

Normally PostgreSQL :sql:`numeric` values are converted to Python
`~decimal.Decimal` instances, because both the types allow fixed-precision
arithmetic and are not subject to rounding.

Sometimes, however, you may want to perform floating-point math on
:sql:`numeric` values, and `!Decimal` may get in the way (maybe because it is
slower, or maybe because mixing `!float` and `!Decimal` values causes Python
errors).

If you are fine with the potential loss of precision and you simply want to
receive :sql:`numeric` values as Python `!float`, you can register on
:sql:`numeric` the same `Loader` class used to load
:sql:`float4`\/:sql:`float8` values. Because the PostgreSQL textual
representation of both floats and decimal is the same, the two loaders are
compatible.

.. code:: python

    conn = psycopg.connect()

    conn.execute("SELECT 123.45").fetchone()[0]
    # Decimal('123.45')

    conn.adapters.register_loader("numeric", psycopg.types.numeric.FloatLoader)

    conn.execute("SELECT 123.45").fetchone()[0]
    # 123.45

In this example the customised adaptation takes effect only on the connection
`!conn` and on any cursor created from it, not on other connections.


.. _adapt-example-inf-date:

Example: handling infinity date
-------------------------------

Suppose you want to work with the "infinity" date which is available in
PostgreSQL but not handled by Python:

.. code:: python

    >>> conn.execute("'infinity'::date").fetchone()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    psycopg.DataError: Python date doesn't support years after 9999: got infinity

One possibility would be to store Python's `datetime.date.max` as PostgreSQL
infinity. For this, let's create a subclass for the dumper and the loader and
register them in the working scope (globally or just on a connection or
cursor):

.. code:: python

    from datetime import date

    # Subclass existing adapters so that the base case is handled normally.
    from psycopg.types.datetime import DateLoader, DateDumper

    class InfDateDumper(DateDumper):
        def dump(self, obj):
            if obj == date.max:
                return b"infinity"
            else:
                return super().dump(obj)

    class InfDateLoader(DateLoader):
        def load(self, data):
            if data == b"infinity":
                return date.max
            else:
                return super().load(data)

    # The new classes can be registered globally, on a connection, on a cursor
    cur.adapters.register_dumper(date, InfDateDumper)
    cur.adapters.register_loader("date", InfDateLoader)

    cur.execute("SELECT %s::text, %s::text", [date(2020, 12, 31), date.max]).fetchone()
    # ('2020-12-31', 'infinity')
    cur.execute("SELECT '2020-12-31'::date, 'infinity'::date").fetchone()
    # (datetime.date(2020, 12, 31), datetime.date(9999, 12, 31))


Dumpers and loaders life cycle
------------------------------

Registering dumpers and loaders will instruct Psycopg to use them
in the queries to follow, in the context where they have been registered.

When a query is performed on a `~psycopg.Cursor`, a
`~psycopg.adapt.Transformer` object is created as a local context to manage
adaptation during the query, instantiating the required dumpers and loaders
and dispatching the values to perform the wanted conversions from Python to
Postgres and back.

- The `!Transformer` copies the adapters configuration from the `!Cursor`,
  thus inheriting all the changes made to the global `psycopg.adapters`
  configuration, the current `!Connection`, the `!Cursor`.

- For every Python type passed as query argument, the `!Transformer` will
  instantiate a `!Dumper`. Usually all the objects of the same type will be
  converted by the same dumper instance.

  - According to the placeholder used (``%s``, ``%b``, ``%t``), Psycopg may
    pick a binary or a text dumper. When using the ``%s`` "`~PyFormat.AUTO`"
    format, if the same type has both a text and a binary dumper registered,
    the last one registered by `~AdaptersMap.register_dumper()` will be used.

  - Sometimes, just looking at the Python type is not enough to decide the
    best PostgreSQL type to use (for instance the PostgreSQL type of a Python
    list depends on the objects it contains, whether to use an :sql:`integer`
    or :sql:`bigint` depends on the number size...) In these cases the
    mechanism provided by `~psycopg.abc.Dumper.get_key()` and
    `~psycopg.abc.Dumper.upgrade()` is used to create more specific dumpers.

- The query is executed. Upon successful request, the result is received as a
  `~psycopg.pq.PGresult`.

- For every OID returned by the query, the `!Transformer` will instantiate a
  `!Loader`. All the values with the same OID will be converted by the same
  loader instance.

- Recursive types (e.g. Python lists, PostgreSQL arrays and composite types)
  will use the same adaptation rules.

As a consequence it is possible to perform certain choices only once per query
(e.g. looking up the connection encoding) and then call a fast-path operation
for each value to convert.

Querying will fail if a Python object for which there isn't a `!Dumper`
registered (for the right `~psycopg.pq.Format`) is used as query parameter.
If the query returns a data type whose OID doesn't have a `!Loader`, the
value will be returned as a string (or bytes string for binary types).
