"""
A minimal scheduler to schedule tasks to run in the future (async version).

Inspired to the standard library `sched.scheduler`, but designed for
multi-thread usage from the ground up, not as an afterthought. Tasks can be
scheduled in front of the one currently running and `Scheduler.run()` can be
left running without any tasks scheduled.

Tasks are called "Task", not "Event", here, because we actually make use of
`[threading/asyncio].Event` and the two would be confusing.
